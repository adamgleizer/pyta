# What data will be sent?
The main data that will be sent are the files that you check with PyTA. We also record which errors were caught on check, and the configuration file used. No identifying information will be sent with the data.

# Who will the data be sent to?
The data will be sent to a server hosted at the University of Toronto in Canada. Researchers at the University of Toronto will have access to the data in order to analyse it.

# How will the data be anonymised?
No identifying information (e.g. username, machine name) is sent to the server. 
A hash of the HWID is sent to identify when an upload comes from the same device, but this in no way identifies the user or device.

# How can I opt in/out?
To change your participation in this research, open your .pylintrc configuration file and set `pyta-upload-permission = no`. Please note that the closest configuration file to a file checked with PyTA will be used.
